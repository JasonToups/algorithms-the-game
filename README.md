# Welcome to Algorithms: The Game
Do you think algorithms are boring???

How could they be, when you turn them into a game?

Let's approach studying algorithms as a fun game with puzzles to stimulate your brain and inspire creativity.

## What is this???
Algorithms: The Game is a collection of coding challenges in Javascript with a playful game-based context for each of the algorithms.

After cloning this repo locally, the challenges are placed into folders that can be spun up using [VSCode's Live Server plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

Articles based off of the challenges are written in Markdown to then be published on different platforms, explaining the algorithm & runtime.

The [GitHub Pages Site](https://jasontoups.github.io/algorithms-the-game/binary-search/index.html) is a place that connects all of the pages for each challenge. It's a bare-bones site and not the primary focus of this project. 

The details of the challenge are built onto the page, so the applicant doesn't have to scroll up and down a single .js file to read more of the details of the challenge.

## Why was this built?

This project was written & built to help both technical interviewers & applicants perform better in their roles. It's a way to help inspire & guide engineering applicants as they apply for roles. And to help technical interviewers present their challenges in a way that's easier to understand for the applicant and provides a bit more personality than simply asking the applicant to return the correct answer. 

### Technical Interviewers

For engineers who host technical interviews, this provides greater context to the live-coding session for the applicant. When an algorithm is presented as a game, it's more fun and can ease the stress of live coding with a stranger. Plus, if you build the challenge off of commonly understood games, the rules have already been established and the applicant's understanding of the exercise is enhanced.

Providing some pre-written code will give the applicant a head-start, and allow them to put the pieces together for what's being asked. Detailing the data types of the inputs & outputs helps out considerably. Providing some sample inputs and invoking the main function with the input argument saves time, and helps the applicant understand the challenge by seeing what's being passed into the function.

When conducting an interview in this way, you can observe the way the applicant is tackling the challenge, rather than providing the applicant little more than some instruction and then wasting time clarifying the details of the challenge, and establishing the terms of the algorithm.

Technical Interviews are a necessary part of the software developer career journey, and is only one aspect of being a great engineer. Many great engineers buckle under the social pressure of a technical interview, and they can be passed up, when maybe live coding with a stranger isn't their comfortable space to shine.

### Applicants

Use these challenges to help inspire you to do the hard work of drilling algorithms. It can be exhausting to prioritize solving algorithms over every other responsibility in your day.

But if you approach them as a game, with puzzles to solve, the technical challenges become more fun. It's all a matter of context & perspective.

Fork & clone this repo down & spin it up in your Integrated Development Environment & pick a challenge to solve yourself. Maybe duplicate the folder for a challenge & remove the working parts of the functions to solve them yourself.
